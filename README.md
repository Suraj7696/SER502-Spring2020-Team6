SARS is a procedural language and as a result, we are using the Top-Down parsing technique to make the program flow unidirectional.

We are building the parser using SWI - prolog.

As of now, we are using the data structure ‘List’.

We will be using python as our lexical analyzer to generate a “.tokens” files, this “.tokens” file will contain the input in partnership with the grammar that we are implementing. Then SWI - prolog is used to generate the parse tree which will act as our intermediate code and another evaluate SWI - prolog code will be used to evaluate the parse tree and generate a result.
